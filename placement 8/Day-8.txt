Data Structures
A specialized format for organizing,processing,retrieving and sorting data. While there are several basic and advanced structure types,any data structure is designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose so that it can be accessed and worked with appropriate ways.
array has the base address present in it.
arr=[23,45,56,67,78]
base address and indices =0 have the same value.
base address +size*number of values or indices.
Specifications
1)organizing data
2)accessing methods
3)degree of associativity
4)processing alternatives for information
Two Types
1)Linear=stacks,queues
2)Non-linear= graphs,trees
PRIMITIVE DATA STRUCTURES= integer,float,character,pointer
NON-PRIMITIVE DATA STRUCTURES= array,lists,files
LISTS= Linear Lists, Non-linear lists
Algorithms
Time Complexity:-
Big-0=worst case
Omega-0= best case
Thetha-0=average case
LINKED LISTS=elements can be dynamically allocated.
1)Singly Linked List= collection of nodes where each node holds two fields; head and tail
1-->Insertion,deletion,traversing,searching
2)Doubly LInked List= we can traverse in both the directions. takes more time to insert or delete as both the previous and the next address needs to be updated.
2--->insertion,deletion,traversing,searching
APPLICATIONS
1)implements stacks,queues,binary trees and graphs of pre-defined size.
2)implements dynamic memory management functions of operating system.
.next=address
.data= data
asymptotic time complexity to add a element in the list=0(n).
